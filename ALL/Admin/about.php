			<h1>Who We Are</h1>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				Growing up as minorities, we all have heard of the term GLASS ceiling, which is a metaphor used to represent an invisible barrier that keeps a given demographic from rising beyond a certain level of advancement. GLVSS represents flipping that whole connotation upside down. The V represents the Vision that we project for ourselves - that there are no boundaries or walls except for the ones that we put up in our minds.
				<br>
				<br>
				GLVSS proudly embodies the culture of streetwear and fashion. Every frame is meticulously designed to be a statement about aesthetic and precise craftsmanship.
			</div>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				Everything we do is for the minority, the creator, and the visionary.
				<br>
				<br>
				We are a lifestyle brand that is a reflection of true life with its ups and downs, wins and losses. We hope to be a voice and inspiration to those who wish to grow with us. We are a transparent brand that wants to share our journey, and learn yours in the process.
			</div>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				<br>
				To the rebels and the free-thinkers. To the movers, the shakers, the difference-makers.
			</div>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				<br>
				Be you.
			</div>
